              Hi, I'm Nilushanth. I created this platform, PathMind, as a sandbox to hone my web development skills. My hope is that it can help others maintain an organized and goal-oriented learning journey. The source code for this site is open-source and can be found here: 
              <a href="https://github.com/nilu-t">GitHub Repository</a>. 
              If you find this platform useful, consider supporting my work through the following BuyMeACoffee link: 
              <Link to="/BuyMeACoffee">Support with a Coffee â˜•</Link>
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default BuyMeACoffee;
